Assignment 8.1 - Creating a 3D Environment

In this scene, I introduced a dynamic interaction where the player picks up a wine bottle from the living room table using raycasting and places it on a new surface â€“ can be the kitchen or desk etc. I did that by creating an ObjectInteraction script. I enhanced the script to include raycasting for detecting the bottle and dropping it to a new surface. The bottle attaches to a designated HoldPoint near the camera for a natural carrying effect. This interaction adds a layer of immersion to the scene, encouraging exploration and enhancing the player's sense of agency. By enabling object manipulation, the environment feels more interactive and alive, allowing players to engage more deeply with the space and its storytelling potential.
