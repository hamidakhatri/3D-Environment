# 3D-Environment

## Assignment 8.1 - Creating a 3D Environment  

This project is part of Assignment 8.1, where I created an interactive 3D environment that enhances player engagement through object interaction. The centerpiece of this assignment is a dynamic feature where the player can pick up and place a wine bottle using raycasting. This interaction adds depth to the scene, making it more immersive and engaging.

## Features  
- **Dynamic Object Interaction:**  
  Players can pick up a wine bottle from the living room table and place it on a new surface, such as a kitchen counter or desk, by interacting with it in the scene.

- **Raycasting for Detection:**  
  Using a custom `ObjectInteraction` script, the system employs raycasting to detect the wine bottle, allowing precise and intuitive interaction. 

- **Natural Carrying Effect:**  
  The bottle attaches to a designated `HoldPoint` near the camera, creating a natural visual effect while the player carries the object.

- **Interactive and Immersive Environment:**  
  By enabling object manipulation, the scene feels more alive, encouraging exploration and enhancing the player’s sense of agency within the environment.

## Skills Learned  
Working on this project allowed me to develop and refine several valuable skills, including:  
1. **Raycasting in Unity:**  
   Implementing raycasting for detecting objects in the scene and enabling interaction with them.  
   
2. **Scripting in C#:**  
   Creating and enhancing the `ObjectInteraction` script to handle picking up and placing objects seamlessly.  

3. **Object Manipulation and Positioning:**  
   Learning how to attach objects to specific points relative to the player’s view for a natural effect.  

4. **Player Interaction Design:**  
   Gaining insights into designing interactive mechanics that contribute to an engaging user experience.  

5. **Problem-Solving:**  
   Debugging and refining the functionality to ensure smooth interactions and intuitive gameplay.  

6. **Environment Storytelling:**  
   Exploring how simple mechanics can add storytelling potential and deepen the connection between the player and the environment.
